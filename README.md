Methylation beta values analysis (without any packages) of TCGA cancer data collected from UCSC Xena Browser.


DNA methylation is a well-studied and relatively stable regulatory epigenetic mechanism that can be accurately and robustly profiled in various tissues. High-throughput profiling of the DNA methylation status of CpG islands is critical for understanding epigenetic gene regulation. To achieve this, we utilized data from Illumina's Infinium Methylation Assay. Multiple studies have shown that The GPRC5A gene is implicated in cancer development and progression, and plays crucial roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. However, while GPRC5A has been extensively explored at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, its genomic investigation remains comparatively limited. To address this challenge, we performed an investigation into the interrelation of metrics such as Beta and M values using a range of statistical methods. Our analysis revealed that there is no significant correlation between GPRC5A methylation and gene expression in a variety of cancer types.
